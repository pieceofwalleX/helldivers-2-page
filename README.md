# HELLDIVERS II

Quick Helldivers II Page

USED:
React + TypeScript + Tailwind

I tried to follow the original ARROWHEAD template.
The only button that its not working is the ENLIST(WIP)<br/>
Basicly this button is another page that would have the difference between Game Version and where to buy.<br/>
The others buttons are working just fine.


FOR DEMOCRACY âœŠ
